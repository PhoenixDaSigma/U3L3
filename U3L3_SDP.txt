1. The base case is when the half of the list being split can be split no further.

2. It recurses whenever a part of the list can be split further.

3. I will reference the first half of the list like so: listName[:(half of list length)], which will cleanly cut the list into two.

4. The two lists will already be sorted, so instead of dealing with one large set of data, there are two more manageable sets that have already been sorted.
